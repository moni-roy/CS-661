## Question 1
Download the dataset the **GSE9782.RData** from web campus. This dataset measures the change in gene expression of myeloma patients. The dataset file contains a gene expression matrix and a group (treated versus untreated). Load the data into R environment;

```{r}
# Loading data using function `load()`
load("GSE9782.RData")

treated <- which(group == "treated")
control <- which(group != "treated")
```

## Question 2
Calculate log base 2 of the expression; Compute the difference in mean log base 2 expression between the two groups (named logFC).

```{r}
# log base 2 of the expression
log2Data <- log(x = dataGSE9782, base = 2)

# a function to calculate the difference in mean
cal_mean_diff <- function(x, treated, control) {
  mean(x[treated]) - mean(x[control])
}
# used apply to call the function
logFC <- apply(log2Data, 1, cal_mean_diff, treated, control)
```

## Question 3
Perform a t-test to compare the control and treated groups; output a data frame that contains the following columns: gene ids (row names of expression data matrix), p-value, t-score, logFC;

```{r}
# Function to calculate p-value
cal_p_value <- function(x, treated, control) {
  t.test(x[treated], x[control])$p.value
}
# Function to calculate t-score
cal_t_score <- function(x, treated, control) {
  t.test(x[treated], x[control])$statistic
}

PValue <- apply(log2Data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = cal_p_value, treated, control)
TScore <- apply(log2Data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = cal_t_score, treated, control)

# rownames used as gene ids
geneIds <- rownames(log2Data)

df <- data.frame(
  row.names = NULL,
  "GeneID" = geneIds,
  "PValue" = PValue,
  "TScore" = TScore,
  "LogFC" = logFC
)

# printing the head of data frame
head(df)
```

## Question 4
Plot the genes with an absolute log fold change > 1 and p-value < 0.05 in red and the remaining ones in black in a volcano plot;

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Volcano plot of the genes with an absolute log fold change > 1 and p-value < 0.05 in red and the remaining ones in black'}
plot(
  x = df$LogFC,
  y = -log10(df$PValue),
  xlab = 'logFC',
  ylab = '-log10(p-value)',
  main = "Volcano plot",
  col = ifelse(abs(df$LogFC) > 1 & df$PValue < 0.05, 'red', 'black'),
  xlim = c(-2, 2)
)
abline(h = -log10(0.05), col = "red")
abline(v = -1, col = "blue")
abline(v = 1, col = "blue ")
```

## Question 5
Perform the analysis at point (3) above using a Wilcoxon test and find the genes that are significant at 5% based on both types of tests (t-test and Wilcoxon);

```{r}
# Function to calculate p-value with Wilcoxon test
cal_p_value_wilcox <- function(x, treated, control) {
  wilcox.test(x[treated], x[control])$p.value
}

# Function to calculate t-score using Wilcoxon test
cal_t_score_wilcox <- function(x, treated, control) {
  wilcox.test(x[treated], x[control])$statistic
}

# used apply to call the function
PValueWx <-
  apply(log2Data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = cal_p_value_wilcox, treated, control)
TScoreWx <-
  apply(log2Data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = cal_t_score_wilcox, treated, control)

# Finding the genes that are significant at 5% based on both types of tests (t-test and Wilcoxon)
dfPvalue <-
  data.frame(row.names = geneIds,
             "PValueWx" = PValueWx,
             "PValueTs" = PValue)

significantGenes <-
  row.names(dfPvalue[which(dfPvalue$PValueWx < 0.05 &
                              dfPvalue$PValueTs < 0.05),])

# Printing the length of significant genes
length(significantGenes)
# Printing the first 10 significant genes
print(significantGenes[1:10])

```

## Question 6
Plot the distribution function of log base 2 expression levels for the data provided;

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.cap='The distribution function of log base 2 expression levels for the data', fig.dim = c(8, 6)}
hist(log2Data, probability = T)
```

## Question 7
Plot the values of the gene with the maximum absolute expression change using box plots to compare the gene’s values in control versus condition.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Box plots to compare the gene’s values in control versus treated'}

maxGene_df <- data.frame(group = group,
                         value = log2Data[which(abs(logFC) == max(abs(logFC))),])

maxGene_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = group, y = value)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic()

```
